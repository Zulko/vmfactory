    """ 
    This function enables to draw a graph manually using
    Matplotlib's interactive plotting capabilites.
    
    In a first phase you are asked to place the nodes (left-click
    to place a node, right-click to remove the last node, Enter
    when finished).
    In a second phase you are asked to place the edges ( click on
    two nodes to select an edge, remove an edge by selecting it again,
    Enter when finished). To go faster in this phase you can also
    select an edge by clicking just one node and hitting enter, it
    will be assumed that the first node was the last node of the
    previous edge. This enables to rapidly draw "paths" of edges.
    
    Parameters
    -----------

    grid
      If `True`, the points positions are a posteriori
      projected on a grid for better visual appeal
    
    grid_N
      resolution of the grid, if any. 
    
    
    Returns
    --------
    
    graph
      A networkx graph object representing the canvas

    
    Examples
    --------
    
    >>> from vmfactory.canvas import canvas_editor
    >>> G = canvas_editor()
    >>> vmaze = Vmaze(G, start=0, goal=1)
    >>> vmaze.draw_quick() # draw with matplotlib
    >>> print vmaze # print the edges, nodes positions.
    >>> vmaze.to_file('mycanvas.can') # save for later use
